# Housing Price Prediction with Random Forest Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts housing prices using the Random Forest regression algorithm. This project is designed to help you understand and implement predictive modeling for real estate pricing.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features and attributes. It utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble method, to build a robust regression model.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `housing.csv`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `script.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading.
